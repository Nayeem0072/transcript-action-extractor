# LangGraph Meeting Action Item Extractor

Extracts structured action items from raw meeting transcripts using a parallel LangGraph pipeline. Supports multiple LLM providers — run fully locally via Ollama, or use Gemini or Claude APIs for higher accuracy.

---

## Features

- Splits transcripts into 20-turn chunks that preserve conversational context
- Filters irrelevant chunks (greetings, small talk, audio glitches) with a free keyword scorer — no LLM cost
- Extracts action items, decisions, and suggestions from all relevant chunks **concurrently** (wall time = slowest single chunk, not the sum)
- Resolves pronouns and references within each chunk — descriptions are always self-contained
- **Semantically merges cross-chunk duplicates** and resolves vague references that span chunk boundaries (`"I'll handle that"` ↔ the task it refers to from a prior chunk)
- Cleans ASR noise (filler words, repeated phrases) and normalizes verbs
- Deduplicates actions across all chunks and produces a chronologically sorted final list

---

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `langchain` | LLM chain abstraction |
| `langchain-openai` | Ollama (OpenAI-compatible) provider |
| `langchain-anthropic` | Claude provider |
| `langchain-google-genai` | Gemini provider |
| `langgraph` | Graph workflow engine |
| `pydantic` | Data models and structured output |
| `python-dotenv` | `.env` file loading |

---

## Configuration

The project root `.env` file controls which provider is active and where API keys come from. Provider-specific model and generation settings live in `configs/`.

### Minimal `.env`

```env
# Pick one provider
ACTIVE_PROVIDER=gemini_mixed   # or: claude | ollama

# API keys (only the one your provider needs)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Supported providers

| `ACTIVE_PROVIDER` | Config file | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini_mixed` | `configs/gemini_mixed.env` | Gemini Flash — fast, accurate, recommended |
| `claude` | `configs/claude.env` | Claude Haiku — strong reasoning, Anthropic API |
| `ollama` | `configs/ollama_glm.env` | Local inference via Ollama — no data leaves machine |

---

### Provider: `gemini_mixed` (recommended)

Uses Google's Gemini API for extraction. Fast and cost-effective.

```env
ACTIVE_PROVIDER=gemini_mixed
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
```

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| Temperature | 0.2 |
| Max tokens | 4096 |
| Timeout | 120 s |

---

### Provider: `claude`

Uses Anthropic's Claude API.

```env
ACTIVE_PROVIDER=claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Temperature | 0.2 |
| Max tokens | 4096 |
| Timeout | 120 s |

---

### Provider: `ollama` (local)

Runs models locally. No data leaves your machine.

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull the model:

```bash
ollama run glm-4.7-flash
```

2. Set in `.env`:

```env
ACTIVE_PROVIDER=ollama
LANGGRAPH_API_KEY=ollama   # any non-empty string; Ollama ignores it
```

---

### Adding a new provider

1. Create `configs/<name>.env` with `PROVIDER=<type>` (where type is `gemini`, `claude`, or `ollama`) and the per-node variables.
2. Register it in `src/langgraph_llm_config.py` (`_provider_env_map`).
3. Set `ACTIVE_PROVIDER=<name>` in `.env`.
4. Add any API key to `.env` (gitignored).

---

## Usage

**Default files** (`input.txt` → `output.json`):

```bash
python run_langgraph.py
```

**Custom input** (output still goes to `output.json`):

```bash
python run_langgraph.py my_transcript.txt
```

**Custom input and output:**

```bash
python run_langgraph.py my_transcript.txt my_output.json
```

**As a Python module:**

```bash
python -m src.langgraph_main my_transcript.txt my_output.json
```

**As a library:**

```python
from src.langgraph_workflow import extract_actions

actions = extract_actions(transcript_raw="<your transcript text>")
# returns a list of dicts, one per action item
```

### Input format

Plain text transcript with `Speaker: text` lines:

```
John: ok so main thing today is the phoenix project timeline
Sara: should we send the client an update email today
John: yes good point — ill draft it after this
Priya: can you include the phased delivery plan
```

JSON input is also supported if the file contains a `transcript_raw` field.

---

## Pipeline

The pipeline is a **linear** LangGraph graph with no loops. After the segmenter chunks the transcript, all relevant chunks are extracted **concurrently** in the parallel extractor node. A single follow-up LLM call then resolves any cross-chunk semantic issues before the final deduplication and sorting passes.

## Node Details

### 1. Segmenter *(no LLM)*

Parses the transcript into `Speaker: text` turns using a regex, then groups them into chunks of **20 turns** each. Larger chunks mean fewer LLM calls and keep most intra-conversation references (pronouns, topic callbacks) within a single chunk where the extractor can resolve them.

**Output:** list of text chunks, each containing up to 20 speaker turns.

---

### 2. Parallel Extractor *(LLM — concurrent)*

This node does two things in sequence:

**Step 1 — Keyword relevance filter (free):** Each chunk is scored by counting how many action-signal keywords it contains (`"will"`, `"should"`, `"need to"`, `"can you"`, `"deadline"`, `"i'll"`, `"schedule"`, etc.). A score of 0 means the chunk is purely conversational (greetings, small talk) and is skipped. This costs nothing and avoids burning LLM calls on filler content.

**Step 2 — Concurrent extraction:** All chunks that passed the filter are submitted to a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (capped at 6 concurrent workers). Each thread calls the LLM independently with the same structured extraction prompt, which instructs the model to:

- Extract every utterance with its speaker, intent, and resolved context
- Produce fully self-contained `action_item` descriptions (expand pronouns using surrounding turns within the chunk)
- Tag each action with 2–4 short subject keywords (`topic_tags`) for vocabulary-independent semantic matching
- Record what an unresolved cross-chunk reference appears to point to (`unresolved_reference`), when the context cannot be resolved within the current chunk alone
- Assign a confidence score to each action

Because threads run in parallel, total wall time is the latency of the **slowest** single chunk, not the sum of all chunks.

**Output:** combined, chunk-ordered list of `Segment` objects from all relevant chunks.

---

### 3. Evidence Normalizer *(no LLM)*

Cleans all segments and converts `action_item` segments into `Action` objects:

- **ASR noise removal** — strips filler words (`um`, `uh`, `er`, `ah`, `like`, `you know`)
- **Whitespace normalisation** — collapses multiple spaces
- **Cross-chunk deduplication** — drops exact-text-match duplicates from any chunk
- **Meta-action filtering** — drops utterances that acknowledge note-taking rather than committing to work (e.g. `"noted"`, `"writing that down"`, `"adding to list"`)
- **Verb normalisation** — maps informal phrases to canonical verbs (`"take care of"` → `"fix"`, `"gonna"` → `"will"`)
- **Action creation** — converts each surviving `action_item` segment into a typed `Action` object with `meeting_window`, `source_spans`, and confidence

---

### 4. Cross-chunk Resolver *(1 LLM call)*

Addresses two failure modes that chunk-isolated extraction cannot handle:

1. **Same task, different vocabulary** — `"handle the API gateway migration"` (chunk 1) and `"prepare migration plan with rollback"` (chunk 2) share few words but describe the same task. The text-similarity deduplicator would miss this; the resolver catches it using `topic_tags`.
2. **Cross-chunk pronoun resolution** — `"I'll do that"` in chunk N where `"that"` was introduced in chunk N-1.

The node formats all extracted actions into a compact prompt listing each action's index, chunk number, speaker, `topic_tags`, optional `unresolved_reference`, and description. A single LLM call returns:

- **`merge_groups`** — groups of action indices that represent the same real-world task (e.g. `[[0, 2]]`). For each group, the most specific (longest) description is kept as the representative; `assignee`, `deadline`, `topic_tags`, and `source_spans` are merged from all members.
- **`updates`** — field patches for individual actions: a rewritten self-contained description for vague references, or a missing `deadline`/`assignee` linked from a related action in another chunk.

**Skip condition:** automatically skipped when there is only 1 chunk or fewer than 2 actions — nothing to resolve.

**Fallback:** if the LLM call fails or returns an invalid structure, the action list passes through unchanged (same output as if the node did not exist).

---

### 5. Global Deduplicator *(no LLM)*

Merges actions that refer to the same real-world task across all chunks. Two actions are considered duplicates when all of the following are true:

- **Similar verb** — exact match or within a synonym group (`fix`/`handle`/`deal with`, `send`/`email`, `review`/`check`)
- **High description overlap** — ≥ 40% word overlap after removing stop words
- **Close meeting window** — within 3 chunks of each other

When merging a group, the representative is the action whose speaker is also the assignee (the person actually doing the work). Missing deadline or assignee fields are filled from other members of the group.

---

### 6. Action Finalizer *(no LLM)*

Enforces the output schema and drops low-quality results:

- Skips actions without a description
- Drops actions with confidence below 0.3 (likely hallucinations or noise)
- Defaults `assignee` to `speaker` if no assignee was extracted
- Normalises verbs to canonical forms
- Deduplicates `source_spans` within each action
- Sorts the final list chronologically by `meeting_window[0]`

---

## Output

Written to `output.json` (or the path you specify). A JSON array, one object per action item.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | `string` | Full, self-contained description of what needs to be done |
| `assignee` | `string \| null` | Person responsible (defaults to speaker if not specified) |
| `deadline` | `string \| null` | When it is due (`"end of month"`, `"March 15"`) or `null` |
| `speaker` | `string` | Who raised the action in the meeting |
| `verb` | `string` | Normalised action verb (`"fix"`, `"send"`, `"review"`) |
| `confidence` | `float` | Extraction confidence score (0.0–1.0) |
| `source_spans` | `string[]` | Segment IDs the action was derived from |
| `meeting_window` | `[int, int]` | Chunk range `[start, end]` where the action was discussed |
| `topic_tags` | `string[]` | Subject keywords used for cross-chunk semantic matching (e.g. `["client", "email", "scope"]`) |
| `unresolved_reference` | `string \| null` | Short phrase describing a cross-chunk reference that could not be resolved during extraction; `null` when the description is fully self-contained |

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Draft email to Client Delta to reset expectations on the delivery date, including phased delivery plan and scope change impact",
    "assignee": "John",
    "deadline": "after this meeting",
    "speaker": "John",
    "verb": "send",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "source_spans": ["a3f1c2d4e5b6"],
    "meeting_window": [1, 1],
    "topic_tags": ["client", "email", "scope"],
    "unresolved_reference": null
  },
  {
    "description": "Schedule bug bash session before release",
    "assignee": "John",
    "deadline": "March 10",
    "speaker": "John",
    "verb": "schedule",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "source_spans": ["f7e2b1c9a032", "c1a4d7e82b91"],
    "meeting_window": [1, 2],
    "topic_tags": ["bug-bash", "testing", "release"],
    "unresolved_reference": null
  }
]
```

An execution log is written to `output_log.txt` with per-node timing, segment counts, and the final action list.

## Performance

### Optimization impact (`input_very_small.txt`, 63 turns, `ACTIVE_PROVIDER=gemini_mixed`)

| Stage | Before (sequential) | After (parallel + resolver) |
|---|---|---|
| Chunks | 8 | 4 |
| LLM calls | 22 (sequential) | 4 concurrent + 1 resolver |
| Parallel extraction | ~80 s | ~18 s |
| Cross-chunk resolution | — | ~5 s |
| Total runtime | ~92 s | ~23 s |
| Actions extracted | 5 | 5+ (cross-chunk merges applied) |

### Scaling across transcript sizes (`ACTIVE_PROVIDER=gemini_mixed`)

| Transcript | Turns | Chunks | LLM calls | Extraction | Resolution | **Total** | Actions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `input_very_small.txt` | 63 | 4 | 4 + 1 | ~18 s | ~5 s | **~23 s** | 5 |
| `input_small.txt` | 99 | 5 | 5 + 1 | ~20 s | ~10 s | **~30 s** | 9 |
| `input.txt` | 130 | 7 (1 skipped) | 6 + 1 | ~21 s | ~5 s | **~27 s** | 9 |

The key observation is that total runtime scales only weakly with transcript length. Going from 63 turns to 259 turns (4× more content) adds just ~4 s — because all chunks run in parallel and wall time is bounded by the **slowest single chunk**, not the sum. The cross-chunk resolver adds a fixed sequential pass of 5–10 s regardless of transcript size.
